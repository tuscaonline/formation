If we view the dataframe, we can see it contains information about all the games the Warriors played.  The <code>PLUS_MINUS</code> column contains information on the score, if the value is negative, the Warriors lost by that many points, if the value is positive, the warriors won by that amount of points. The column <code>MATCHUP</code> has the team the Warriors were playing, GSW stands for Golden State Warriors and TOR means Toronto Raptors. <code>vs</code> signifies it was a home game and the <code>@ </code>symbol means an away game.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"9d883150-29da-41d4-adf3-bdc3125ffa6d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Since https://stats.nba.com does not allow api calls from Cloud IPs and Skills Network Labs uses a Cloud IP.\n","# The following code is comment out, you can run it on jupyter labs on your own computer.\n","# games = gamefinder.get_data_frames()[0]\n","# games.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8433facc-089e-4e7a-917b-da78e937dd56","metadata":{},"source":["you can download the dataframe from the API call for Golden State and run the rest like a video.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7c6ddec7-73e9-4a51-a1cc-51ccef214a54","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import requests\n","\n","filename = \"https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%205/Labs/Golden_State.pkl\"\n","\n","def download(url, filename):\n","    response = requests.get(url)\n","    if response.status_code == 200:\n","        with open(filename, \"wb\") as f:\n","            f.write(response.content)\n","\n","download(filename, \"Golden_State.pkl\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"8ef5ce73-7876-4d03-b507-cdd747047922","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["file_name = \"Golden_State.pkl\"\n","games = pd.read_pickle(file_name)\n","games.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b10a284c-58c7-48fe-a428-e77c58217cfc","metadata":{},"source":["We can create two dataframes, one for the games that the Warriors faced the raptors at home, and the second for away games.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ab23f531-9709-42b4-b1e3-95fbbd60721f","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["games_home=games[games['MATCHUP']=='GSW vs. TOR']\n","games_away=games[games['MATCHUP']=='GSW @ TOR']"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"842eff6e-aaa9-40b9-9c29-1b7959862ef1","metadata":{},"source":["We can calculate the mean for the column <code>PLUS_MINUS</code> for the dataframes <code>games_home</code> and <code> games_away</code>:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"012bd011-ce59-4369-97d0-685f2560e7e9","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["games_home['PLUS_MINUS'].mean()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b5baec1b-2d4d-43f7-a93f-ae0a74022739","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["games_away['PLUS_MINUS'].mean()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ae3fa1bc-465f-4ff4-87b2-0d4ddfbc076f","metadata":{},"source":["We can plot out the <code>PLUS MINUS</code> column for the dataframes <code>games_home</code> and <code> games_away</code>.\n","We see the warriors played better at home.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"60d3ff83-2cd5-45cc-bd2b-9612e6fa6361","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n","\n","games_away.plot(x='GAME_DATE',y='PLUS_MINUS', ax=ax)\n","games_home.plot(x='GAME_DATE',y='PLUS_MINUS', ax=ax)\n","ax.legend([\"away\", \"home\"])\n","plt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6a0d5a36-e516-41dc-99f6-fc244153c5d3","metadata":{},"source":["<h2>Quiz</h2>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0372af0e-c423-45c0-9437-eac4c83aec0b","metadata":{},"source":["Calculate the mean for the column <code>PTS</code> for the dataframes <code>games_home</code> and <code> games_away</code>:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"3891cef7-81f2-443b-989f-16f21e4c9637","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c8c5058f-057f-4053-a55f-8d6924de4820","metadata":{},"source":["<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>\n","\n","```python\n","games_home['PTS'].mean()\n","\n","games_away['PTS'].mean()\n","\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"120fafa7-717a-4c4d-be20-316e16730a2b","metadata":{},"source":["## Authors:\n","\n","[Joseph Santarcangelo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-s-50398b136/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkPY0101ENSkillsNetwork19487395-2021-01-01)\n","\n","Joseph Santarcangelo has a PhD in Electrical Engineering, his research focused on using machine learning, signal processing, and computer vision to determine how videos impact human cognition.
